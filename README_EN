# FE & Linux Learning Log 🐧🪿

Hi, I'm learning computer science fundamentals **by doing**.

This repository is my personal learning log for:
- Fundamental Information Technology Engineer Exam (FE)
- Linux basics (with Raspberry Pi)
- Algorithms & data structures

Not a tutorial.
Not a polished product.
Just honest learning records.

## Why

I want to become someone who can *build, understand, and fix things*.

I don't aim to be a specialist locked in one box.
I aim to be **the kind of engineer who can connect dots across layers**:
hardware, OS, networks, and applications.

I want to become someone who can do a bit of everything.  
Curiosity is the engine that drives me. 🚗⛽️

## What I'm doing now

- Reviewing FE topics (network, DB, algorithms)
- Practicing Linux commands and system basics
- Running small experiments on Raspberry Pi 5

I learn best by:
- writing things in my own words
- breaking stuff
- fixing it again

## Roadmap (2025–2026)

Planned certifications (subject to curiosity explosions):

- FE (Fundamental Information Technology Engineer)
- AP (Applied Information Technology Engineer)
- LPIC-2
- AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate (SAA)

Certifications are not the goal.
Understanding systems is.

## Rules of this repo

- Keep things simple
- Don't pretend to understand what I don't
- Small progress is still progress
- Logs over perfection

If something here looks messy,  
that's probably because I was learning for real.
